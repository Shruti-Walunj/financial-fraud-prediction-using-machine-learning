# 🔍 Financial Fraud Prediction Using Machine Learning  

# 📄 Description:  
Built a machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent transactions from a real-world dataset containing **6M+ rows and 10 features**. Developed a Streamlit web app where users can input transaction details and get real-time fraud predictions.  

# 📂 Dataset:  
The full dataset is available on Kaggle:  
👉 [Financial Fraud Detection Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sriharshaeedala/financial-fraud-detection-dataset)  

# 🧩 Key Tasks:  
Performed data cleaning (handled missing values, standardized transaction features)  

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

Encoded categorical features (transaction type)  

Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler  

Trained and evaluated a Logistic Regression model  

Saved the trained ML pipeline using Joblib  

Developed a Streamlit app (`fraud_detection.py`) for real-time fraud prediction

# 📊 Insights
Fraud concentrated in TRANSFER and CASH-OUT transactions  

Fraudsters often drain sender’s balance to zero in one move  

Rule-based system (`isFlaggedFraud`) misses many fraud cases  

Machine learning model improved detection performance beyond rule-based checks
