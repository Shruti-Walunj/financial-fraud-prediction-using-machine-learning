# 🔍 Financial Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning  

# 📄 Description:  
Built a machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent transactions from a real-world dataset containing **6M+ rows and 10 features**. Developed a Streamlit web app where users can input transaction details and get real-time fraud predictions.  

# 📂 Dataset:  
The full dataset is available on Kaggle:  
👉 [Financial Fraud Detection Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sriharshaeedala/financial-fraud-detection-dataset)  

# 🧩 Key Tasks:  
Trained ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
Handled missing values & class imbalance (SMOTE)  
Engineered features (balance differences, transaction type encoding)  
Evaluated models with Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC  
Saved trained model pipeline with Joblib  
Built a Streamlit app (`fraud_detection.py`) for real-time predictions  

# 📊 Insights
Fraud concentrated in TRANSFER and CASH-OUT transactions  
Fraudsters often drain sender’s balance to zero in one transaction  
Rule-based system (`isFlaggedFraud`) misses many fraud cases  
ML models significantly improved fraud detection beyond rules
